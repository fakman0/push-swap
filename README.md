# push-swap

push_swap is a program that sorts a stack of integers using only a few simple operations. The program is efficient, portable, and well-tested. It is a good option for anyone looking for a program to sort a stack of integers.

Here are the main operations that the program uses:
```
    sa (swap): Swaps the top two elements of the stack.
    sb (swap): Swaps the top two elements of the stack b.
    pa (push): Pushes the top element of the stack b onto the stack a.
    pb (push): Pushes the top element of the stack a onto the stack b.
    ra (rotate): Rotates the top element of the stack a to the bottom.
    rb (rotate): Rotates the top element of the stack b to the bottom.
    rra (reverse rotate): Rotates the top element of the stack a to the top.
    rrb (reverse rotate): Rotates the top element of the stack b to the top.
```
The program takes a list of integers as input, and it outputs a series of operations that will sort the list. The goal is to sort the list using the minimum number of operations possible.
